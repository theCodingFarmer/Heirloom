# Heirloom Farm 👨🏻‍🌾
> A local CSA Farm Site built with Sanity and Gatsby

# Quick start

To start the project locally run `yarn start`. This command open two new tabs and run Sanity and Gatsby as well as start a browser window to start development. Go to the following: 
- Sanity Studio runs at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)
- Gatsby runs at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- GraphQL Playground for Gatsby [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql)

## Root Level Commands:
- `yarn sanity-graphql` - run this after data structure changes  (run from the root)
- `yarn sanity-deploy` - Running this command builds and deploys the studio, making it available on [heirloom.sanity.studio](https://heirloomfarm.sanity.studio). 
- `yarn sanity-undeploy` - run to change the hostname or remove the Studio from the web

# Deploying Sanity Studio Changes

Navigate to `/studio` folder and run `sanity deploy`. If this errors, you may need to log in by running `sanity login`. 
For more details on deployment see this [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/docs/deployment) article.   

To log-in navigate to `/farmer-login`. 

# Customize

## Icons

Under `src/components/_config` you will find further files that allow for configuration of _social_ and _navigation_ icons.  

Some parts of the app still uses [Font Awesome Solid Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free).

### Navigation

To change or add further menu links you can adjust the maps in `client/src/components/_config/menu-links.js`.   

### Social

In `client/src/components/_config/social-icon-list.js` you are able to add further social links or edit the link property to point to your social profiles. Those social links are currently displayed in the _header_ and _footer_. Feel free to reuse them where ever
you like.

## Change the Theme

In order to change the colors of the theme you can just change the values of the css variables in the `client/src/styles/variables.styl` file. Every color in the _CSS_ is based on those css variables. This allows you to quickly apply a different theme of your choice.

```styl
