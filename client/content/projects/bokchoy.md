Bok choy (aka pak choi or Chinese cabbage) can be eaten raw, steamed, in soups or stir-fried. The stems can be eaten like celery, paired with peanut butter or cheese. Storage Tip: Keep it in its plastic bag. It should keep well for a few days and may last for a week, but the longer you wait, the less perky it will be.
