Beets can be eaten raw, roasted, steamed, grilled, boiled or baked. The greens can be used like spinach or chard. Some people say there’s no need to peel the roots, other say they taste too much like dirt if you don’t. Everyone agrees cooking them in the peels makes them easier to peel. Beet juice can stain, so wearing an apron while prepping them is advised. Storage Tip: Separate the greens from the roots. Refrigerate the greens in a plastic bag and use soon. The roots will keep well for weeks in the refrigerator in a paper or perforated plastic bag.
